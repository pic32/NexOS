v1.01.04 8/12/2022
 - Added the ability to keep track of how long a TASK has executed for.
 - Added a method to ToString() all the TASK execution times.
 - Added the check statement for the right version of the RTOSConfig.h file.
 - Added in the TASK unique ID feature.  Each TASK is assigned one at creation.
 - Added in the ability to get a task execution history list with their latest
   execution times.
 - Added the GenericTypes.h file to the project.  This needs to be present in
   the project folder to compile correctly.
 - Tested out the stack usage of the IO Buffer TASK and Maintenance TASK.  Now
   those stack sizes are smaller and reflect better the size they should be.
 - Modified the file ff.h in the FileSystem project to use GenericTypes.h.
 - Modified the PIC32 ADC port to support 16 bit ADC data reads.
 - Updated all example projects to latest RTOSConfig.h file.

v1.01.03 7/20/2022
 - Updated the path in OS_Callback.c for a relative location for the *.h file.
 - Added in the method IOBufferGetState().
 - Fixed a bug in IOBufferReadLine() where the existing data in the IO_BUFFER
   was not read into the user buffer.
 - Added the ability to analyze a TASK stack with the method AnalyzeTaskStack().
   This method returns how many words are left in the stack untouched.
 - Added the ability to catch a TASK stack pointer that overflowed during a
   context switch by the OS.  The method TaskStackOverflowUserCallback() is 
   called when this happens.
 - The system stack is now introduced for interrupt handling.  Its size can
   be configured up in RTOSConfig.h.
 - Fixed up some of the headers in OS_EventCallback.h that were missing.

v1.01.02 7/11/2022
- Updated the CallocMemory() to have the additional parameter NumberOfItems.
- Added the USING_GET_HEAP_USED_IN_BYTES_METHOD and 
  USING_GET_HEAP_REMAINING_IN_BYTES_METHOD into RTOSConfig.h.

v1.01.01 6/2/2022
- The File System Project is now incorporated.  This project shows
  integration of the NexOS with the FatFs.  There is one example
  project which has 2 tasks writing data to their own files.  There
  are 2 configurations for the project.  Configuration 1 has the
  default media as a SD card, and configuration 2 has the default
  media as a flash IC (SST26VF064B).

v1.01.00 5/25/2022
- This version has support for the UART, CAN, and ADC IO_BUFFERS.
- Updated the interrupt handlers for some new EVENTS.
- Fixed a bunch of bugs.  After this release we will be tracking 
  them to have a log.

v1.00.00 10/14/2020
- This is the original release of the NexOS.
